"""Build the Pygmalion v2 robot description - URDF and MJCF - from one mass-property file.

Inputs
  massprops   ~/pyg_fea/steps/robot_massprops_step.json (massprops_step.py) today; the
              Fusion 360 export with the same schema once the connector is reachable.
              Frame: CAD global mm. Bodies: pelvis, hip_pitch_link, hip_roll_link, thigh,
              shin, foot (left leg).
  meshes      pygmalion_locomotion/assets/pygmalion_v2/meshes/*.stl (meshes_step.py),
              already in each body's link frame, simulator axes, metres.

Frames. CAD -> sim is a +90 deg turn about z: sim = (-y_cad, x_cad, z_cad), so the robot
walks along +x with the left leg at -y, exactly the convention of the existing
pygmalion.xml. Link origins sit on joint points: base at the pelvis centre (CAD 0,70,60);
hip_pitch/hip_roll/thigh at the hip point (-123.7,70,60) where the three hip axes are
concurrent (measured from the motor cylinders, massprops_step.py); shin at the knee
(-123.7,115,-310); ankle_pitch/foot at the ankle (-123.7,145,-800). Joint axes and signs
follow the existing model (hip_pitch +y, hip_roll +x, hip_yaw -z, knee -y, ankle_pitch -y,
ankle_roll -x) so policies, rewards and init keyframes keep their meaning.

The ankle is SERIAL (pitch then roll): the two RS03, the cranks and the clevis fork are on
the shin, the rods half/half, the ankle cross on the foot (massprops_step.py). The upper
body is a placeholder lump on base_link - mass from the catalogue-corrected final-design
table (docs/82), COM and inertia scaled from the old base_link - until the Fusion export
carries the arms.

Checks: joint points must reproduce the CAD leg length; every body inertia must be
positive definite; the MJCF must compile in MuJoCo; total mass is printed against the
final-design table.

Usage: build_robot.py [--massprops=path] [--out=...]   (mjlab .venv python)

Canonical Fusion-variant filenames are always prefixed with exactly one of
``FullDoF_``, ``SemiFullDoF_`` or ``LegOnly_``.  Pass the revision portion to
``--tag``; an already-prefixed tag is normalized instead of double-prefixed.

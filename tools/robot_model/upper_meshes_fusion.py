"""Pull the upper-body meshes out of Fusion 360 - the STEP the campaign has covers the legs only.

The torso, the shoulder link and the arm exist only in the live Fusion document, so their
triangles are fetched over the MCP connector (`meshManager` per BRep body, low-quality
tessellation, assembly coordinates in cm) and written as STL in each rigid body's link frame,
matching the convention the leg meshes already use: origin on the joint, simulator axes
(x forward, y left, z up), metres.

Suppressed geometry is skipped: the light bulb of `ArmR_fullDoF` is off, and its 6.497 kg
alternative arm must not appear in either the mass properties or the picture.

Three things the 2026-08-26 run got wrong, and what replaces them:

**Never recurse inside a Fusion script.** The connector execs the submitted source in a module
whose `__getattr__` recurses on every name lookup - `tools/assembly_viewer/README.md` recorded
that in August, which is why `dump_fasteners.py` walks with an explicit stack - so a recursive
tree walk multiplies frames until Fusion's embedded Python blows its ~1 MB stack. The old code
here recursed twice (`collect`, and `find` once per slice), and after its 2026-08-26 run the
script host was left permanently wedged: every `fusion_mcp_execute` since, an empty script
included, returns the same `RecursionError: Stack overflow (used 993 kB)` raised inside that
`__getattr__`, while `fusion_mcp_read` still answers. Cause is inferred, not reproduced - the
wedge cannot be cleared from this side to try again - but it fits, and it explains "29 bodies
could not be fetched" exactly: once wedged, every remaining body fails whatever its size. Both
scripts below walk the occurrence tree with an explicit stack.

**Fail fast on a wedged host.** `mcp_client.HostWedged` is raised on the first sighting instead
of being retried; retrying costs five round trips and twelve seconds per body to relearn a fact
that cannot change without an add-in restart on the CAD PC.

**Never write into the asset directory until the whole set is in hand.** Every STL is built in
a staging directory. The live meshes are replaced only after all four rigid bodies fetched with
zero skipped bodies, and the files being replaced are copied to a timestamped backup first. The
old code wrote each group as it finished, so a failure halfway through left `arm.stl` holding a
partial mesh next to meshes from the previous generation.

Usage (mjlab venv, Fusion MCP reachable):

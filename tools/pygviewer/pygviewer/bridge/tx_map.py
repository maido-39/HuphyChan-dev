"""Sim -> HUPHY direction: canonical sim-joint radians -> HUPHY limb/motor cal-space degrees.

This is the EXACT inverse of ``huphy_udp.py``'s telemetry conversion, and deliberately reuses
its ``JointMap`` (same ``joint_map_huphy.json``, same 12-row hard-failure-on-unknown table) so
the two directions of the bridge can never independently drift.  It has NO import of
``huphy`` and never touches a socket - it is pure conversion math plus the joint table, so it
is unit-testable on any machine, including this one, without HUPHY installed (docs/123
section 4: the robot host is remote and this module has to be provably correct before it ever
runs there).

Units, once more because getting this wrong is exactly how a sim2real project loses a day:
sim side is ALWAYS rad / rad-s / N*m (schema.py's rule).  HUPHY side is ALWAYS degrees / deg-s
/ N*m, in "cal space" (``cal = sign*raw + offset``, already zero- and sign-corrected for the
physical joint - see ``huphy_udp.py``'s module docstring for the full picture including why
``vel``/``tau`` need the same sign fixup as ``pos`` even though HUPHY's own calibration layer
does not apply it to them).

``travel_sign`` is NEVER guessed here - same as ``huphy_udp.py``, it is read once from the
model contract's ``joint_contract[name]["travel_sign"]`` and only ever looked up.

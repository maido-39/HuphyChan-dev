# OVERVIEW + CLOSE-UP video + formatted report, every run incl. tests). The model kept launching train.py
# directly and skipping video (even via a self-made config-test exemption). This blocks ANY direct
# `python ... scripts/train.py` so the launcher is the ONLY path. The launcher calls train.py as a SUBPROCESS
# (not seen here), so `bash scripts/run_training.sh ...` is allowed. Robust: any parse error -> exit 0.
